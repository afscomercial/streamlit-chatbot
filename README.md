# Streamlit Chatbot âœ¨

A lightweight chatbot built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and the open-source `microsoft/DialoGPT-small` language model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). This repository is ready to be deployed to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) automatically through GitHub Actions.

## Features

* ðŸ“œ **Open-source LLM** â€“ Uses a small conversational model that runs comfortably on the free GPU or CPU hardware offered by Spaces.
* ðŸ’¬ **Chat interface** â€“ Powered by Streamlit 1.30+ `st.chat_*` components.
* ðŸ”„ **Persistent history** â€“ Session-state keeps the discussion context on the client side.
* ðŸš€ **1-click deploy** â€“ Push to the `main` branch and GitHub Actions mirrors the repository to your Space.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Launch the app
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

1. **Create a new Space** (type: *Streamlit*) at `https://huggingface.co/new-space` or let the Action do it for you automatically.
2. **Generate a write token** in your Hugging Face account settings and add it to the repository secrets as `HF_TOKEN`.
3. Optionally add another secret called `SPACE_REPO` with the full name of the Space (e.g. `your-username/streamlit-chatbot`).

On each push to the `main` branch the GitHub workflow located at `.github/workflows/deploy-to-spaces.yml` will:

* Check out the code.
* Install the `huggingface_hub` CLI.
* Create the Space (if it doesn't exist).
* Force-push the contents of the repository to the Space, triggering a rebuild and redeploy.
